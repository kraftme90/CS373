# CS 373- Defense Against the Dark Arts

This class will be dealing with computer security and defense at a high level, looking at many different topics.
This repo will hold the weekly blogs, found [here](https://shephern.github.io/CS373).
It will also be where I work on my other coding assignments, whatever they may be.
