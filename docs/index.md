This blog will serve to document my learning and understanding of the CS 373 course.
CS 373 is the Defense Against the Dark Arts course at Oregon State University.
It will teach me the basics of anti-malware, malware forensics and analysis, and recovery techniques on both Windows and Linux systems.
Each week I will be completing the labs and listening to the lectures.
What I learn will be documented here.
