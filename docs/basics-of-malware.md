### Lecture

In the lectures this week I learned about basic malware classifications and analytics.
The first lecture was mainly a review for me
Malware or Malicious Software
Viruses
 parasitic, polymorphic
 worm
Trojans
PUP (Potentially Unwanted Programs)

Malware code is copied a lot
High power stuff is custom and directed at specific exploits
Biggest infection vector is the user

Malware Vocabulary:

 - White: A clean, harmless program
 - Black: Dangerous and unwanted
 - Gray: Unknown
 - Sample: Just a collected malware
 - Goat: Sacrificial system, to be corrupted in analysis
 - Honeypot: A sitting system to collect malware
 - Replication:
 - Hash: Used to refer to malware samples

Already knew about hashes
Malware can be VM aware
NO False positives


Naming Conventions
Not entirely universal
 - Type
 - Family
 - Varients
 - !MD5 portion

Transport
Zip the malware, password with infected
Rename extension, so it can't be Transport

Analysis
Snapshots before and after
bait the Malware
execute Malware
