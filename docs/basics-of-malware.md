### Lecture

In the lectures this week I learned about basic malware classifications and analytics.
The first lecture was mainly a review for me, from the Intro into Security course.
Over the lecture I did learn quite a bit, and solidify some other topics.

I learned about varying degrees of malware, from viruses and worms to PUPs, or Potentially Unwanted Programs.
Viruses can be parasitic, polymorphic, or worms.
I didn't know about trojans, which are programs that are presented as other programs.
This is to make it more likely to download and install them on victim machines.
There are also PUPs, which are often downloaded along with other programs, just as a unchecked box.
They are mostly harmless, but are specifically directed to mining data.
The majority of malware is copied and altered, or combined with other malware to attack different systems.
People writing malware are often after a large group, instead of a single individual or company, so the malware most used is cobbled together on the cheap, it would seem.
High powered malware is targeted and directed at specific exploits and targets.
This sort of attack is rare because it can take a lot of work to write custom malware, which can be far more complex.
Another reason that most malware is cobbled together is that the biggest infection vector is still the user and high powered malware isn't needed to take out a large crowd.

#### Malware Vocabulary:

 - White: A clean, harmless program
 - Black: Dangerous and unwanted
 - Gray: Unknown
 - Sample: Just a collected malware
 - Goat: Sacrificial system, to be corrupted in analysis
 - Honeypot: A sitting system to collect malware
 - Replication:
 - Hash: Used to refer to malware samples

Malware can be VM aware
NO False positives


Naming Conventions
Not entirely universal
 - Type
 - Family
 - Varients
 - !MD5 portion

Transport
Zip the malware, password with infected
Rename extension, so it can't be Transport

Analysis
Snapshots before and after
bait the Malware
execute Malware
